This is a series of re-rankings of BGG's game list using a scraper and different algorithms / weightings to present various lists by preferences

---------------
Instructions
---------------
1. Click on the folder that best represents your board game preferences, preferring a game weight does not mean it is a filter, it merely weights games in that direction on the list.  
- A heavier game or lighter game than selected may still appear, particularly if it is highly rated, it will just be lower down than on other lists.
- This allows people with certain weight-preferences to still become aware of highly popular & highly rated games other than their chosen weight, but it doesn't flood their list with them either.
- The 'I prefer ALL games' list is not a copy of BGG, it uses a calculation that punishes lower rated games more and rewards popular games more, but there are no calculations that bias weight like the other ones.

2. Open the "ALL_RANKINGS.txt" file within your preferred folder, the name, date, and bgg rank is listed.  Enjoy!

3. Open "RANKINGS_BY_YEAR.txt" to see a top 25 for every year tailored to your preference, to see the best games of all years without weighting open the "I prefer ALL games folder"

disagreement ranks the items that are most disagreed upon by the selected list and bgg 

raw_objects.json is for developers / troubleshooting, it is an export of all of the objects with their calculated scores, in general:
- Scores of <1 likely means you will think it is bad
- Scores of 1-2 likely means you will think it is meh
- Scores of 2-2.5 likely means you will think it is decent
- Scores of 2.5 - 3 likely means you will think it is good
- Scores of 3+ likely means you will think it is phenomenal

Nate's preferred list is "medium-light", almost all of his games are on the top-300 or so of that list.

Enjoy!
